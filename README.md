# Quality Engineer Take-Home Challenge

This repository contains the submission for the Quality Engineer take-home challenge. The challenge consists of three parts focusing on exploratory testing, web UI test automation, and API test automation.

## Project Structure

* **`/Task 1 - Exploratory Testing`**: This directory contains a single markdown file detailing the exploratory testing session performed on the Good Budget web application. It includes:
    * Exploratory testing charters.
    * Findings and any bugs discovered.
    * Prioritization of charters.
    * Risk mitigation considerations for the web application.
* **`/Task 2 - Web UI Test Automation`**: This folder houses the test automation framework and tests for the Good Budget web application.
    * It includes the automated checks for three business-critical E2E flows.
    * A `README.md` file within this folder explains the setup, how to run the tests, and the chosen tech stack/approach.

Please refer to the `README.md` files within each task's subdirectory for specific details and instructions.
